# OpenLTTO
The OpenLTTO Project is an attempt to recreate the Lazer Tag Team Ops protocol, and game system, in a completely open-source solution. Eventually our intent, is to expand on the LTTO system, adding new functionality, and features, while maintaining backwards compatibility with this classic Lazer Tag gear.

> This Project wouldn't be possible without all the hard work of Richie Mickan https://github.com/rmick
> His work on recreating the LTTO Protocol, and the development of the Combobulator app are core to the firmware and capabilities of this project.

> Additionally this is built on top of the excellent product developed and released by Hasbro/Tiger Electronics. And the work done by Tag Ferret to release the technical specs, and unlock much of the magic of the protocol, and the inner workings.

We intend to do this via a collection of open-source hardware components that can act as building blocks, to build anything you might require for a Lazer Tag game (Taggers, Hosting Pods, Zone controllers, utilities, etc). And an opensource firmware to operate it all. 

# OpenLTTO Barrel Module
The OpenLTTO Barrel Module is designed to mimic the form factor of the LTTO Deluxe blasters "Dual Barrel" Setup, with one optical tube being transmit, and one optical tube for receive. It is designed to easily fit in the end of a 3D Printed optical tube, with a 25mm focusing lens. 

The module includes 5 Pin IR IN and IR OUT ports, as well as an optimized 1A LED Driver for the IR LED, along with paired Muzzle Flash LEDs. The Module supports both outdoor (high power, 1A), and indoor (low power) modes, controlled from the motherboard. And includes a power ballast (capacitor, and inrush arrester pair) to prevent ripples, and ensure smooth operation.
